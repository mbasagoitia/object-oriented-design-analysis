# Design Patterns

Patterns were not "invented." Rather, they identify common problems that you will run into in object-oriented software design.

Design patterns come from the discipline of cultural anthropology--within a culture, individuals will agree on what is considered "good design." Cultures make judgments on good design that transcend individual beliefs.

Patterns, the structures and relationships that appear frequently in many different well-designed objects, providean objective basis for judging design.

**Christopher Alexander** described patterns in his book The Timeless Way of Building" and argued that it was possible to objectively define "high quality" or "beautiful" buildings. By studying high-quality structures that solve similar problems, he could discover similarities between the designs and these similarities were what he called patterns.

The **pattern** provides an approach that can be used to achieve a high-quality solution to its problem. Patterns have common problems, but how you apply the solution is never the same twice. You have lots of freedom to think about how the pattern can be best applied to your situation.

Four elements of Alexander's patterns:

- The name of the pattern
- The purpose of the pattern; what problem it solves
- How to solve the problem
- The constraints we have to consider in our solution

## Design Patterns in Software

Are there problems in software that occur frequently that can be solved in similar ways? The Gang of Four book set forth 23 common design patterns and their relationships.

Design patterns assert that the quality of software systems can be measured objectively.

- What is present in a higher quality design (X's) that is not present in a poorer quality design?
- What is present in a poorer quality design (Y's) that is not present in a good quality design?

We would then want to maximize the X's and minimize the Y's in our design efforts

## Key Elements of Software Patterns

- Name
- Intent
- Problem
- Solution
- Participants
- Consequences
- Implementation
- Structure

Patterns let us:

- Reuse solutions that have worked in the past for problems many of us see regularly
- Have a shared vocabulary around software design
- Gain experience reuse (vs just code reuse)
- Gain high-level conceptual perspective
- Ability to think more abstractly
