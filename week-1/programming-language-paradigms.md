# Programming Language Paradigms

## Main Programming Paradigms

- Imperative (procedural and OO languages); specific statements to execute
    - Procedural (Fortran, C)
    - Object-oriented (C#, Java, C++, Ruby)
    - Parallel processing

- Declarative (logic, functional, and specification languages); identifying functions and their relationships
    - Logic (Prolog, Datalog, ASP)
    - Functional (Lisp, Haskell, Clojure, F#)
    - Database
    - Data flow
    - Specification (HTML, CSS, SQL DDL)

### Procedural Language Characteristics

Often used for access to low-level hardware and system resources, or for scientific or educational applications

- Fortran, C, and one way to approach Python
- Procedure or function calls for modularity
- Top-down design
- Sequential execution
- Variable scope or access (global, local, etc.)
- Emphasis on data
- Limited abstraction support (example: using C structs and function pointers vs classes and objects)

### Functional Language Characteristics

Often used for data science, distributed systems, communications, or other concurrent applications

- Lisp, Haskell, Clojure, F#, elements of Scala, etc.
- First-class and higher order functions
- Immutable variables and pure functions; no side effects or unexpected changes
- Recursion
- Referential transparency
- Lazy evaluation
- Pattern matching
- Concurrency and parallelism support

### Logic-Based Programming Languages

Often used for natural language processing, AI, and expert systems

- Prolog and other logic-based languages
- Declarative rule-based programming
- Logical inference
- Predicate logic
- Unification
- Backtracking and searching
- Non-procedural execution

### Domain-Specific Languages

- LaTeX, R, MatLab, SQL
- Targeted to a specific kind of problem, rather than a general purpose language that is aimed at any kind of software problem
- Internal and external DSLs

### Graphical or Visual Programming

- Scratch

### The Object-Oriented Paradigm

- Designing systems with networks of objects collaboration to fulfill the responsibilities (requirements) of the system
- Objects as conceptual units that combine both data and behavior
- Objects with identity and type clarity
    - Attributes to keep track of its state
    - Methods to function and interact properly
- Defining class definitions for objects to clarify creation, relationships, and usage
