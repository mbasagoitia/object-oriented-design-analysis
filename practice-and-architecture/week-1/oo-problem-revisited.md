## An OO Problem Revisited

## UML Diagramming as an OOAD Process

Once you have written base requirements and use cases to fulfill them and you have reviewed use cases with clients to validate tasks and priorities, you're ready to create designs using UML--class diagrams, activity diagrams, state diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc. using information in the use cases and requirements as inspiration.

Progressive elaboration of design details comes from iterative review and update of the designs.

## Pattern-Based Design

Thinking in patterns:

1. Identify the patterns--examine the problem space for patterns that may apply
2. Analyze and apply the patterns--for each pattern you recognize, perform these steps to develop a conceptual design
    a. Order the patterns by context creation--which of the patterns sets a structure for starting to apply other patterns
    b. Apply that pattern and expand design--given the pattern context order, select the next pattern to add to the high-level conceptual design
    c. Note additional patterns--Identify any additional patterns that might have been recognized during your analysis and add them to your list
    d. Repeat--repeat the steps for any patterns not yet brought into the conceptual design
3. Add detail--move from the conceptual design into specification (class) and implementation (method/attribute) details
